      <h1>Sun analogy</h1>
      <p class="lead">Light in the cathedral</p>
      <p>The daily comparison is based on the need to get to know the good. The common nature of good things belongs to one, and one characteristic belongs to one nature. Plato therefore introduced the comparison of the sun on the basis of the importance of getting to know him well. A relationship between a visible thing and an observer is born in nature by a third factor, that is
and the Sun. So our vision is a passive actor that can only see by the active Sun.</p>

      <h1>Cave analogy</h1>
      <p class="lead">The role of light in vision</p>
      <p>A man suffering from the bondage of false vision in the cave analogy, who first sees only shadows and then, freed from his shackles, can see the fire itself as a source of light, which is the likeness of the visible sun, and then goes all the way out of the cave. The soul, therefore, can view intellectual good purely from color to color. In this process, light is important in the relationship between knowledge and visible things, for only through it can it observe the cave shadows and then reach the world of ideas, which is accessible to the common sense, without any observation.</p>
